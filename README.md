## Description
We offer you a chatbot that gives some informations about video games and that can recommend video games in function of your own tastes.

Please write "Help" in the discord channel to have some hints about how to use the bot

You can also say hi to him or say bye

Please don't ask the bot to save to the favorites a video game released after April 2019. But you can still ask for some informations about a video game of any year. The dataset we are using for recommendation system knows only video games before April 2019.

## Recommender System (a faire)
Please describe the recommender system in your chatbot. How it works and the details about it.

## Language Processing (faire video wit.ai)
Please describe the language processing step. Using external services, AI, regular expression, etc. or mix of them.
If you have reg ex, please write them with an example:

The first step is to know if the bot has to respond to a video game info, a recommendation or semething else. For that, we use a regex:

| Regex    | Intent | Example    |
|----------|--------|------------|
| ```\b(?P<greeting>Hi|Hello|Hey|hello|hi)\b``` | Hello | Hi |
| ```\b(bye|exit|quit|leave|stop)\b``` | Exit | bye |
| ```(tell me about|who made|when was|released)``` | Videogame | Tell me about Skyrim<br>Who made Black Ops II?<br>When was Grand Theft Auto V released? |
| ```(recommend me)``` | Recommendation | Recomend me some games |
| ```\b(help)\b``` | Help | Help |


After that, if the intent "Videogame" is triggered, we use Wit.ai to return an intent and entities and to learn

If you use other services like wit.ai, please include a video from the trained texts. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
